/DynamicAssets/[asset bundle id]/Resources – place to put assets dynamically loaded via Resources.Load(...) method. Common folder contains only base resources packed with game, resources from other folders are compiled into Asset Bundles and loaded from our servers on demand. Note, if you’re not using asset bundles you can only have one Resources folder.
